# TF BASE 

### Phase 1

The goal of Phase 1 is to build a demo which whos layre 4-7 routing  
into Azure using customized "apps" specific in showing each layer.  

### Phaes 1 Steps.

Phase 1 covers three areas. 
The original thinking is that there will be 3 repos:

- Terraform. 
- Apps
- GitHub Actions

Terraform and Apps feed GitHub Actions.  I have not come up with the final repo.

### Apps

Apps are not business user specific apps, but infrastructure apps.  

Examples:

- nginx
- nc 
- curl
- bind9 networking tools.  ie nslookup
- az and aws cli
- simple python scripts.
